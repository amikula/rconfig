Thanks to everyone I included here. RConfig would not exist without their contributions.

Mike Sandler, Kurt Stephens, CashNetUSA (CNU):
  - The core of logic of RConfig is based on a stand-alone class called CnuConfig, that resided in the CNU codebase.
  - It was originally created by Mike Sandler as a config solution for CNU's internal web apps.
  - It only supported yaml files, but it boasted overlay support to unobstrusively load environment specific configs,
    and a dottable notation not seen in any other ruby config libraries.
  - It was later enhanced by Kurt Stephens to support indifferent access, reload support, and callbacks, making it
    a enterprise worthy config solution.
  - I have made some signifcant enhancements to RConfig since that original debut, to make it a truly complete
    configuration solution, all of which are in this gem.
  - The original CnuConfig, that RConfig was forked from was open-sourced by CNU as ActiveConfig. It can be found on
    GitHub for anyone interested.
